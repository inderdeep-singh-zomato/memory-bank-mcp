A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for managing Memory Banks, allowing AI assistants to store and retrieve information across sessions.

## Overview 📋

Memory Bank Server provides a set of tools and resources for AI assistants to interact with Memory Banks. Memory Banks are structured repositories of information that help maintain context and track progress across multiple sessions.

## Features ✨

- **Memory Bank Management**: Initialize, find, and manage Memory Banks
- **File Operations**: Read and write files in Memory Banks
- **Progress Tracking**: Track progress and update Memory Bank files
- **Decision Logging**: Log important decisions with context and alternatives
- **Active Context Management**: Maintain and update active context information
- **Mode Support**: Detect and use .clinerules files for mode-specific behavior
- **UMB Command**: Update Memory Bank files temporarily with the UMB command
- **Robust Error Handling**: Gracefully handle errors and continue operation when possible
- **Status Prefix System**: Immediate visibility into Memory Bank operational state

## Directory Structure 📁

By default, Memory Bank uses a `memory-bank` directory in the root of your project. When you specify a project path using the `--path` option, the Memory Bank will be created or accessed at `<project_path>/memory-bank`.

You can customize the name of the Memory Bank folder using the `--folder` option. For example, if you set `--folder custom-memory`, the Memory Bank will be created or accessed at `<project_path>/custom-memory`.

For more details on customizing the folder name, see [Custom Memory Bank Folder Name](docs/custom-folder-name.md).

## Recent Improvements 🛠️

- **Customizable Folder Name**: You can now specify a custom folder name for the Memory Bank
- **Consistent Directory Structure**: Memory Bank now always uses the configured folder name in the project root
- **Enhanced Initialization**: Memory Bank now works even when .clinerules files don't exist
- **Better Path Handling**: Improved handling of absolute and relative paths
- **Improved Directory Detection**: Better detection of existing memory-bank directories
- **More Robust Error Handling**: Graceful handling of errors related to .clinerules files

For more details, see [Memory Bank Bug Fixes](docs/memory-bank-bug-fixes.md).

## Configuring in Cursor 🖱️

Cursor is an AI-powered code editor that supports the Model Context Protocol (MCP). To configure Memory Bank MCP in Cursor:

1. **Use Memory Bank MCP with npx**:

   No need to install the package globally. You can use npx directly:

   ```bash
   # Verify npx is working correctly
   npx @movibe/memory-bank-mcp --help
   ```

2. **Open Cursor Settings**:

   - Go to Settings (⚙️) > Extensions > MCP
   - Click on "Add MCP Server"

3. **Configure the MCP Server**:

   - **Name**: Memory Bank MCP
   - **Command**: npx
   - **Arguments**: `@movibe/memory-bank-mcp --mode code` (or other mode as needed)

4. **Save and Activate**:

   - Click "Save"
   - Enable the MCP server by toggling it on

5. **Verify Connection**:
   - Open a project in Cursor
   - The Memory Bank MCP should now be active and available in your AI interactions

For detailed instructions and advanced usage with Cursor, see [cursor-integration.md](docs/cursor-integration.md).

### Using with Cursor 🤖

Once configured, you can interact with Memory Bank MCP in Cursor through AI commands:

- **Initialize a Memory Bank**: `/mcp memory-bank-mcp initialize_memory_bank path=./memory-bank`
- **Track Progress**: `/mcp memory-bank-mcp track_progress action="Feature Implementation" description="Implemented feature X"`
- **Log Decision**: `/mcp memory-bank-mcp log_decision title="API Design" context="..." decision="..."`
- **Switch Mode**: `/mcp memory-bank-mcp switch_mode mode=code`

## MCP Modes and Their Usage 🔄

## How Memory Bank MCP Works 🧠

Memory Bank MCP is built on the Model Context Protocol (MCP), which enables AI assistants to interact with external tools and resources. Here's how it works:

### Core Components 🧩

1. **Memory Bank**: A structured repository of information stored as markdown files:

   - `product-context.md`: Overall project information and goals
   - `active-context.md`: Current state, ongoing tasks, and next steps
   - `progress.md`: History of project updates and milestones
   - `decision-log.md`: Record of important decisions with context and rationale
   - `system-patterns.md`: Architecture and code patterns used in the project

2. **MCP Server**: Provides tools and resources for AI assistants to interact with Memory Banks:

   - Runs as a standalone process
   - Communicates with AI assistants through the MCP protocol
   - Provides a set of tools for managing Memory Banks

3. **Mode System**: Supports different operational modes:
   - `code`: Focus on code implementation
   - `ask`: Focus on answering questions
   - `architect`: Focus on system design
   - `debug`: Focus on debugging issues
   - `test`: Focus on testing

### Data Flow 🔄

1. **Initialization**: The AI assistant connects to the MCP server and initializes a Memory Bank
2. **Tool Calls**: The AI assistant calls tools provided by the MCP server to read/write Memory Bank files
3. **Context Maintenance**: The Memory Bank maintains context across sessions, allowing the AI to recall previous decisions and progress

### Memory Bank Structure 📂

Memory Banks use a standardized structure to organize information:

- **Product Context**: Project overview, objectives, technologies, and architecture
- **Active Context**: Current state, ongoing tasks, known issues, and next steps
- **Progress**: Chronological record of project updates and milestones
- **Decision Log**: Record of important decisions with context, alternatives, and consequences
- **System Patterns**: Architecture patterns, code patterns, and documentation patterns

### Advanced Features 🚀

- **UMB Command**: Temporarily update Memory Bank files during a session without committing changes
- **Mode Detection**: Automatically detect and switch modes based on user input
- **File Migration**: Tools for migrating between different file naming conventions
- **Language Standardization**: All Memory Bank files are generated in English for consistency

## Versioning 📌

This project follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) and uses [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) for commit messages. The version is automatically bumped and a changelog is generated based on commit messages when changes are merged into the main branch.

- **Major version** is bumped when there are breaking changes (commit messages with `BREAKING CHANGE` or `!:`)
- **Minor version** is bumped when new features are added (commit messages with `feat:` or `feat(scope):`)
- **Patch version** is bumped for all other changes (bug fixes, documentation, etc.)

For the complete history of changes, see the [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) file.

## Usage 📝

### As a Command Line Tool 💻

```bash
# Initialize a Memory Bank
memory-bank-mcp initialize_memory_bank path=./memory-bank

# Track progress
memory-bank-mcp track_progress action="Feature Implementation" description="Implemented feature X"

# Log a decision
memory-bank-mcp log_decision title="API Design" context="..." decision="..."

## Memory Bank Status System 🚦

Memory Bank MCP implements a status prefix system that provides immediate visibility into the operational state of the Memory Bank:

### Status Indicators

Every response from an AI assistant using Memory Bank MCP begins with one of these status indicators:

- **`[MEMORY BANK: ACTIVE]`**: The Memory Bank is available and being used to provide context-aware responses
- **`[MEMORY BANK: INACTIVE]`**: The Memory Bank is not available or not properly configured
- **`[MEMORY BANK: UPDATING]`**: The Memory Bank is currently being updated (during UMB command execution)

This system ensures users always know whether the AI assistant is operating with full context awareness or limited information.

### Benefits

- **Transparency**: Users always know whether the AI has access to the full project context
- **Troubleshooting**: Makes it immediately obvious when Memory Bank is not properly configured
- **Context Awareness**: Helps users understand why certain responses may lack historical context

For more details, see [Memory Bank Status Prefix System](docs/memory-bank-status-prefix.md).
